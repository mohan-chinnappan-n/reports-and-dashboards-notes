## Event Monitoring

###  Event Monitoring Analytics App 

The Event Monitoring Analytics App is the first built-in way to explore your monitoring data in Salesforce. App creation is easy and with its prebuilt dashboards and datasets, you can start exploring right away. This app helps you drill into your orgâ€™s data and swiftly:

- identify suspicious behavior
- slow page performance
- poor user adoption.


Event monitoring provides tracking for lots of types of events, including:

- Logins
- Logouts
- URI (web clicks)
- Lightning (web clicks, performance, and errors in Lightning Experience and Salesforce1)
- Visualforce page loads
- API calls
- Apex executions
- Report exports
